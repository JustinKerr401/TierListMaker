# TierListMaker Project

## Purpose
Automate the creation of clean, consistent icon sets for community “Group Tier Lists” in the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate scene, eliminating the manual effort required to build icons for large regional player groups.

## Approach
- Designed a script-driven workflow that generates TierMaker-ready icons from structured data.  
- Uses a `.xlsx` input sourced from Google Sheets, allowing users to manage player data efficiently.  
- Integrated dropdown-based character selection to prevent naming mismatches and data errors.  
- Prioritized minimal user effort while maintaining visual consistency across all generated icons.

## Product
A utility that converts a simple spreadsheet into a complete, organized set of TierMaker icons, enabling Smash Ultimate communities to quickly create and share polished regional tier lists without tedious manual asset creation.

## Disclaimer
All components except the script code are my own work. The script itself was written using ChatGPT, based on my logic flow and tool requirements.

## Room for Growth
- Support for multiple characters per player  
- Support for multiple costumes per character  
- Expanded flexibility to better reflect common competitive playstyles and preferences
